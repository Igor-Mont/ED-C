- `printf()` - Returns the number of displayed characters
- `getchar()` - Returns the char captured
- `getc()` - Returns the char captured through the parameter
  - keyboard means `stdin`
- `fgetc()` - Returns the char captured through the parameter, generally is used with text files

**The problem of reading a char last is keyboard buffer, it stores the values concatenated with the \n**

## Escape characters

- `\n` - line break
- `\t` - tab
- `\'` - single quote
- `\"` - double quotes
- `\\` - \

- To solve this problem is necessary add " " in reading function, this way the program will disregard ENTER, TAB and SPACE

## Number of bytes depends on the architecture of the machine

- `sizeof` - Is an opeartor or constant
- Range of values integer: [-2.147.483.648, 2.147.483.647].
- Decrease memory size with `short`
  - `short int`: 2 bytes, [-32.768, 32.767], to print use "%hi" or "%d"
    - if you try to store larger numbers a memory overflow will occur
- Increase memory size with `long`
  - `long long int`: 8 bytes, to print use "%lld" or "%lli"
- Double means 2x float, doulbe = `2 * sizeof(float)`
- `long doulbe`: 12 bytes, to print in windows use `__mingw_printf()`, environment Unix use "%Lf"

## Casting

- `(float) x / y`
- `(int) x / y`

## Increment/Decrement operator

- If used on the right, the operation will be performed after
- If used on the left, the operation will be performed before
- `int result, count = 10`
  - if `result = count++`, the variable result will be 10
  - if `result = ++count`, the variable result will be 11

## Unsigned operator

- Eliminates negative numbers from the range
- Increases the range on the positive side
- `unsigned short int`, to print use %hu or %d, don't need the sign bit and store it in 16 bits not 15
- `unsigned long int`, to print use %lu, don't need the sign bit and store it in 32 bits not 31
- `unsigned char`, to use extended ASCII table (รง, ~, etc), don't need the sign bit and store it in 8 bits not 7
- to set locale, use `setLocale(LC_ALL, "Portuguese")` and import the lib locale.h

## Relational opeartors

- Always returns 1 or 0
- Any value other than 0 is true

## Array

- To fill an array with a string, use sprintf(variable, "string")
- To exclude "Enter" for scanf type `scanf(" %c", &variable)`
  // all string ends with "\0"
